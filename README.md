# C++ Interop testing

## Requirements

* C++ compiler + [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [Swift v5.9](https://www.swift.org/download/)
* [LDC (LLVM D Compiler)](https://dlang.org/download.html)
* [Rust toolchain](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Zig toolchain](https://ziglang.org/download) - replacing cmake to zig-build
